# Simple_Encrypt_Decrypt_with_Textbox_Application_in_Python

Simple Encryption and Decryption Application

# Overview

This application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using a basic one-character shift in ASCII values. The encryption and decryption functionalities are implemented separately in two Python scripts, enc.py for encryption and dec.py for decryption. The graphical interface is built using the tkinter library in Python.

Encryption Script (enc.py)
The enc.py script takes an input text and shifts each character forward by one ASCII value to produce the encrypted text. The encrypted text is displayed on the GUI along with the original text.

Decryption Script (dec.py)
The dec.py script takes an input encrypted text and shifts each character back by one ASCII value to generate the decrypted text. The decrypted text is then displayed on the GUI.

# Usage

enc.py 
Run enc.py to launch the Encryption Generator window.
Enter the text you want to emcrypt in the provied text field.
Click the "Encrypt" button to perform the encryption.
The encrypted ttext will be displayed along with the original input text.

dec.py
Run dec.py to launch the Decryption Generator window.
Enter the encrypted text you want to decrypt in the provided text field.
Click the "Decrypt" button to perform the decryption.
The decrypted text will be displayed along with the encrypted input text.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x

- tkinter library

# How to Run
To the the application, execute the 'enc.py' and 'dec.py' seperately in a Python environment that supports the tkinter library.

# Note
This is a simple demonstration of text encryption and decryption and should not be considered as a secure encryption method for sensitive data.

The purpose of the textbox is to copy and paste so that you won't be able to just write it again
